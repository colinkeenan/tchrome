# tchrome
The script is named 'tchrome' and the desktop calls it 'Toggle Chrome (tchrome)'. This is meant to live on a panel in a launcher. Click to close all Chrome windows and background processes, or launch the version of the Chrome Browser specified in /etc/tchrome.conf if not already running. If running the script from the command line, make sure it runs from bash.
